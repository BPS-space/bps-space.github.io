* [Brett Beauregard's Arduino PID Library](http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginners-pid-introduction/) ([Github Repo](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/)) - A series of blog posts about writing a better PID library for Arduino.
* [Control Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m) - A very thorough video series on optimal control theory.
* [Stanford EE267 IMU Notes](https://stanford.edu/class/ee267/notes/ee267_notes_imu.pdf) - Some notes from a class on virtual reality. Their choices of hardware is questionable but the math is solid. Section 5 and Appendix A are useful for learning about quaternions.
* [Understanding Eular Angles](http://www.chrobotics.com/library/understanding-euler-angles) - Detailed and well written page about eular angles.
* [Understanding Quaternions](http://www.chrobotics.com/library/understanding-quaternions) - An alternative to eular angles. More difficult, however it avoids the infamous problem of gimbal lock and other issues with eular angles.
