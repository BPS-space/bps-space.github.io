## Contributing

Any submissions of self created content must include a .md file describing the content. Whether you're adding a simple schematic library or an in depth tutorial, it needs to have a dedicated page so people can find it. Unfinished articles are allowed, as along as they are marked as such.

If you're just adding a link to a book or another website, then that can simply be added to the index.md file of the appropriate category.

### Adding an Article

1. Make a fork of this repo on [github](https://github.com/BPS-space/bps-space.github.io).
2. Add your article as a .md file in the appropriate folder.
3. Add any assets (pictures, schematic files, etc.) to the assets folder in that category. Each asset should have the name of the article as a prefix, so if the article is "pyro-channels.md", then an asset will be "pyro-channels_schematic1.png".
4. Add a link to the article in the index.md of the category. Make sure it is in the correct position alphabetically.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repo and include a short description.
